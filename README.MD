# Interview question for future emploer

#### What's behind the idea

You can see many lists with questions asked by employers, mostly about specific,
work related topics. Companies have whole departments, standards and methodologies 
keeping their recruitment process effective through hundreds of interviews.

However IT is a bit different and we developers receive dozens of offers for various companies.
When we eventually decide to change our job, we often end up with several offers... 
And don't know what exactly to pick (or reject).

Recently I did some interviews about this topic, to help myself choose from two similar job offers
and decided to write it down for the future.

Notice that my points may not by obvious for people in various countries, especially regarding tax optimizations, contracts etc.

Also many questions shouldn't be asked and you need to be careful. Many of these points are better to ask anonymously or your colleages
working there.
