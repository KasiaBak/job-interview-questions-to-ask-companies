# Interview question for future employer

#### What's behind the idea

You can see many lists with questions asked by employers, mostly about specific,
work-related topics. Companies have whole departments, standards and methodologies 
keeping their recruitment process effective through hundreds of interviews.

However, IT is a bit different and we developers receive dozens of offers for various companies.
When we eventually decide to change our job, we often end up with several offers... 
And don't know what exactly to pick (or reject).

Recently I did some interviews on this topic, to help myself choose from two similar job offers
and decided to write it down for the future.

Notice that my points may not be obvious for people in various countries, especially regarding tax optimizations, contracts etc.

Also, many questions shouldn't be asked and you need to be careful. Many of these points are better to ask anonymously or your colleagues
working there.
